<h1>Infinite Mixture Modeling of Streaming Data with Online Bayesian Moment Matching</h1>
<h3>Wilson Hsu</h3>
<h3>June 2015</h3>

<p>
We investigate the problem of mixture modeling in the context of streaming data, where the number of components is not known a priori and might be infinite. The basic finite mixture model is extended to allow the number of components to vary, and we propose an online Bayesian moment matching algorithm to estimate the posterior distribution. The proposed method is tested on three types of mixtures: mixture of Gaussians, multinomial naive Bayes, and latent Dirichlet allocation.
